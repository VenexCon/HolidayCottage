# Analogue photography website 

## https://negativespace.netlify.app/

This project was to take an interest of mine, and create a website with that interest in mind. The idea was to have a scrolling intro section and subsequent embedded instagram profiles, products section, with a footer referencing github and social media. 

To do: 
1. Inplement a product section, with links to external sites this shoudl be clothes, cameras and film. - Done
2. implement a contact form for enquiries and find out how to link with JS
3. implement 2 scripts of JS. 
4. implement a gallery section, that can be sorted by colours. 
5. Add an FAQ section 
6. add a collpasable nav-bar that uses a hamburger menu to unfold. 


The website is currently hosted on Netlify after searching the best host. 

The intro section which includes a movie quote and subsequent pictures taken using analogue photgraphic cameras.
